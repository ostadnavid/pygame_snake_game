# pygame_snake_game

this is the snake game written on pygame python.

this is the result: `snake_game_human.py`

![picture of snake game](./image.png)

there is a file named `snake_game_ai.py` which has a class called SnakeGame. this is the same as the `snake_game_human.py` but the agent will play this. (**Note: If you want to use `snake_game_ai.py` please go to [link to snake ai repo](https://github.com/ostadnavid/snake_ai) repository. I've made some changes to the game for rewarding system...**)

to see how to use it see `example.py`

i get some lines of code for writing the game from [this repository](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/snake-pygame).

if you get error something like `increase/decrease the width by n and height by m` just make sure that the `w%step == 0` and `h%step == 0`.
